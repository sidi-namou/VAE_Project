Overview
====================
 * The accelerometer sensor demo demonstrates basic usage of the accelerometer and user interface functionalities 
   to implement the data registered by a sensor of the RPK.
 * Every 0.5 seconds the data displayed is updated with what the sensor registers.


Usage
====================
 * This demo does not require user input.
 * Data is taken from the sensor using the "get_acceleration" method and then displayed.
